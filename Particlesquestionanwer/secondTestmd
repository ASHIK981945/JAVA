Basic Java Questions:
What is Java?
Answer: Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is platform-independent and follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle.

What are the main features of Java?
Answer: Some key features of Java include:

Object-Oriented
Platform-Independent
Secure
Multithreaded
Robust
Dynamic
What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
Answer:

JDK (Java Development Kit): Contains tools required to develop, compile, and run Java applications.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides libraries and JVM to run Java applications.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Converts Java bytecode into machine code.
What is the default value of a local variable in Java?
Answer: Local variables do not have default values and must be initialized before use.

What is the size of an int data type in Java?
Answer: The int data type is 4 bytes (32 bits) in Java.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java:
What are the four pillars of OOP?
Answer:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
What is method overloading and method overriding?
Answer:

Method Overloading: When multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
Method Overriding: When a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.
Can a constructor be static in Java?
Answer: No, constructors cannot be static because they are called when an object is created, and static methods belong to the class rather than any object.

What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?
Answer:

final: Used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent class inheritance.
finally: A block that is always executed after a try-catch block, used for cleanup code.
finalize(): A method used for garbage collection before an object is destroyed.
What is an abstract class?
Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).

Advanced Java Questions:
What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?
Answer:

== compares references (memory addresses).
.equals() compares the actual values of objects.
What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
Answer:

Abstract Class: Can have method implementations and instance variables.
Interface: Only contains method declarations (before Java 8). Java 8+ allows default and static methods.
What is multithreading in Java?
Answer: Multithreading is a feature that allows concurrent execution of multiple threads to improve performance.

How can you create a thread in Java?
Answer: Two ways to create a thread:

Extend the Thread class.
Implement the Runnable interface.
What is a try-catch block in Java?
Answer: A try-catch block is used to handle exceptions in Java. The try block contains code that may throw an exception, and the catch block handles the exception.

Coding-Based Questions:
What will be the output of the following Java program?

java
Copy
Edit
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        System.out.println(++x * x++);
    }
}
Answer:

Copy
Edit
121
Explanation: ++x increments x to 11, then x * x++ becomes 11 * 11, resulting in 121.

Write a Java program to check if a number is prime.

java
Copy
Edit
public class PrimeCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 29;
        boolean isPrime = true;

        for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isPrime)
            System.out.println(num + " is a prime number.");
        else
            System.out.println(num + " is not a prime number.");
    }
}
Output: 29 is a prime number.
